# Tennis Scoring System Java

This app allows us to count the points of 2 players in a tennis Game.

There are 2 main functions :
1) /initialise => allows us to reset the counter for both players to zero
2) /update/player/points?playerName= => which takes A or B in order to update the points of the players

We handle as well de deuce rule.

Our functions are called by a react application.
